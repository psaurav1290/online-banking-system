# ONLINE BANKING SYSTEM

## _Overview:_
The Online Banking System aims to provide users with a convenient and secure platform to manage their finances remotely. Built using Spring Boot, the system offers a range of features, including user registration and login, account overview, fund transfer, bill payment, account statement generation, password change, account settings management, deposit and withdrawal functionalities, transaction history tracking, customer support, and secure logout.

By leveraging Spring Boot's powerful capabilities, the Online Banking System ensures scalability, reliability, and easy integration with various databases and third-party services. The use of Spring Security guarantees robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user information and transactions. Additionally, the system incorporates responsive web design principles, allowing users to access and interact with the application seamlessly across multiple devices.

The implementation of these use cases will enable users to efficiently manage their accounts, conduct financial transactions securely, and stay updated on their financial activities through comprehensive reports and statements.
